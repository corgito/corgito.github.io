I've set up this personal page primarily to host my blog.

My interest include:

- Music
- Photography
- Literature
- Philosophy
- Programming, specifically in Python
- Digital privacy
- Consuming less and creating more

For my 9 to 5 I work as a field and events manager with the [Coalition on Human Needs](https://www.chn.org).
I created this site using Jekyll and Emacs.
